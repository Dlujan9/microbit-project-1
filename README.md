## Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, and Lizard Mircobit Game
I commited an extended version of rock, paper, scissors to include 5 weapons instead of 3. The weapons are...
1. rock
2. paper
3. scissors
4. spock
5. lizard

After it's shaken, the microbit chooses a random weapon. The micropython code is at its basic form for the game.
